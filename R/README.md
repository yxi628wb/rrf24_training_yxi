# Reproducible Research Fundamentals 2024 - R

Training: gitflow session
 

Welcome to the **Reproducible Research Fundamentals 2024** training repository. This repository will guide you through all the exercises across the following stages:

- **0. GitHub Workflow**: Gain essential GitHub skills, including how to create branches, commit changes, and open pull requests.
- **1. Data Processing**: Learn to clean and tidy your datasets in preparation for analysis.
- **2. Data Construction**: Build indicators and variables from the processed data.
- **3. Data Analysis**: Conduct analyses using the constructed data.
- **4. Reproducibility Package**: Package all work into a reproducible format for sharing and validation.

Feel free to update this README as you progress through the sessions and customize it to reflect the details of your project. For more details on the elements required for a reproducibility package, refer to our [README template](https://github.com/worldbank/wb-reproducible-research-repository/blob/main/resources/README_Template.md), which you will cover in the **Reproducibility Package** session.

Remember this is what you will share with your peer at the end of the training for review so this needs to be updated before sharing.
